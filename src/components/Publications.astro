    title: "A gentle and rigorous introduction to reinforcement learning.",
    date:"2023",
    description:"In this paper, we will address a computational approach called Reinforcement Learning(RL) and we build in a progressive and simple way its mathematical basis,as well as its main solution methods.",

  {
    title: "The Moving Firefighter Problem",
    date: "2022",
    description: "A generalization of the firefighter problem where the time it takes a firefighter to move from a vertex u to defend vertex v is determined by a function ùúè . This new formulation models situations such as a wildfire or a flood, where firefighters have to physically move from their current position to the location of an entity they intend to defend.",

  },
  {
    title: " A Parallel Rollout Algorithm for Wildfire Supression.",
    date: "2020",
    description: "In this paper, we formulate the problem of optimal Wildfire Suppression as an infinite horizon Decision Process (DP) problem where an agent (e.g., a robotic firefighter) decides which areas to intervene to extinguish the fire. The dynamics of the wildfire is modeled by a cellular automaton.",
